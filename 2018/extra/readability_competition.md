# Code readability competition

After both Toni and I complete a **Day Puzzle**, we send each other the code used to solve it.
For each puzzle, the other must measure the amount of time to comprehension.

## Rules

* The **Winner of each Part** is the one who produced the code with the lowest average time to comprehension
* The **Winner of the Competition** is the one who won most **Parts**
* If a Day, or Part, isn't solved, by one of the participants, no one wins the round

### Guidelines for measuring time
* Timer must be started the second the code is being read, no "pre-glancing" allowed
* Timer must be stopped after **80% comprehension**
* Each Part is to be timed separately

#### 80% Comprehension
* **80% comprehension** is defined as the amount of comprehension that make you confident you could make changes to this code without breaking any test.
* Whether or not making changes would _actually_ break tests is irrelevant
* In a real codebase tests are here to catch you if a misunderstanding sneaked in these last 20%
