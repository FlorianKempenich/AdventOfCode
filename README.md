# My Solutions for The Advent Of Code

## Do yourself a favor, don't spoil yourself! üòä
The Advent of Code is a really fun game... if you play it. If you just glance at the solutions it'll only bring you one of two things:
- **Anxiety**: _"Omg, I would have never solved this!"_
- **Contempt**: _"Pff, I could have done this"_

**None of these are healthy.**  
**Instead, try it yourself and have fun.** ‚ò∫Ô∏è

If you get stuck on a particular problem, instead of reaching for the solution too early, you're welcome to open an issue on this repo. I'll try to take the time to answer you with a hint that wouldn't be a spoil ;)


## Solutions

* Solutions are sorted by year, and then language.
* Not all days are solved in all languages.
* Solutions are usually optimized for readability
